Nothing is read from or written to disk and the entire directory structure is instantiated every time the server is started, eg. changes made through the IMAP protocol (adding/removing messages/flags etc) are not saved permanently. This should ensure that you can write unit tests for clients in a way where a new fresh server with unmodified data is started for every test.\r\n\r\nSeveral clients can connect to the server simultanously but all the clients share the same user account, even if login credentials are different.\r\n\r\nHoodiecrow is extendable, any command can be overwritten, plugins can be added etc (see command folder for built in command examples and plugin folder for plugin examples).\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\nAn user can always login with username `\"testuser\"` and password `\"testpass\"`. Any other credentials can be added as needed.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n### IMAP4rev1\r\n\r\n  * **FETCH** and **UID FETCH** support is partial\r\n  * No **SEARCH** or **UID SEARCH**\r\n  * Other commands should be more or less ready\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get these done one by one. Most of it was already implemented in the previous incarnation  of **hoodiecrow**, so I can copy and paste a lot.\r\n\r\n### Supported Plugins\r\n\r\nPlugins can be enabled when starting the server but can not be unloaded or loaded when the server is already running\r\n\r\n  * **AUTH=PLAIN** (supports **SASL-IR**, ignores **LOGINDISABLED**)\r\n  * **CONDSTORE** partial, see below for CONDSTORE support\r\n  * **ENABLE**\r\n  * **ID**\r\n  * **IDLE**\r\n  * **LITERALPLUS**\r\n  * **LOGINDISABLED** is effective with LOGIN when connection is unencrypted but does not affect AUTH=PLAIN\r\n  * **NAMESPACE** no anonymous namespaces though\r\n  * **SALS-IR**\r\n  * **STARTTLS**\r\n  * **UNSELECT**\r\n  * **XTOYBIRD** to programmatically control Hoodiecrow through the IMAP protocol. Does not require login.\r\n\r\nPlanned but not yet implemented\r\n\r\n  * **SPECIAL-USE** (maybe **XLIST** as well but probably not)\r\n  * **MOVE**\r\n  * **UIDPLUS**\r\n  * **QUOTA**\r\n  * **X-GM-EXT-1** except for **SEARCH X-GM-RAW**\r\n  * **AUTH=XOAUTH2** (maybe **AUTH=XOAUTH2** also)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\nAn user can always login with username `\"testuser\"` and password `\"testpass\"`.
